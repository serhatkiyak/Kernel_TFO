The experiment scripts depend on the web-profiler module
(https://github.com/dtnaylor/web-profiler). web-profiler has been added as a
submodule to this repository; to load it, run:

git submodule init
git submodule update


The python script also expects two files, set_cookie and set_nocookie, created
as per these instructions:

set_cookie should contain:

#!/bin/bash
echo "0x403" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen

set_nocookie should contain:

#!/bin/bash
echo "0x607" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen
